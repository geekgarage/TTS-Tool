# TTS-Tool
TTS tool created to help mutes communicate online and in games
It will possibly give a warning from windows defender as it's created in a script language a long time ago.
if you don't want to run the exe file, you can dowenload the AHK script and then also install AutoHotKey, and then run the ahk script instead, that will not give any warnings and it does the same as the exe.
Just wanted to give you both options

The program is limited to female voices as it's a limitation from google Translate service
